# PHP StdOut Logger for CLI Apps.

## **Purpose:** App Logs outputs to **stdout/stderr** according to **LogLevel** and in **user-defined** format. **IN RUNTIME**!

> And for the hail of Satan, of cource üòà

## **Motivation:** Its might be very helpful for üê≥ Docker fans

> Designed as simple as possible, following [php-fig](https://www.php-fig.org) PSR's and [codestyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style) tools

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING! Today it's for `PHP_CLI` mode only!

### Tiny and _simple-first_ **PHP Logger** library that output data to console's `stdout`/`stderr` in depends of `LogLevel`.

### Implements interfaces defined by [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/).

## Install

```sh
composer require micronext/php-std-logger
```

## Development

Clone this repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/micronext/php-std-logger
cd php-std-logger
composer install
```

## Usage:

```php
<?php

namespace YourAmazingApp;

use Psr\Log\LogLevel;
use MicroNext\StdOut\Logger;

$logger = new Logger;

$logger->emergency("emergency test");
$logger->alert("alert test");
$logger->critical("critical test");
$logger->error("error test");
$logger->warning("warning test");
$logger->notice("notice test");
$logger->info("info test");
$logger->debug("debug test");

// Also, you can call ->log() directly:
$logger->log(LogLevel::NOTICE, "notice throught log test";
$logger->log(null, "log test");
```

## Currently `std output` separated to 2 targets:

> [LogLevel definition @ PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/#5-psrlogloglevel)

```c
stderr << log
when "LogLevel"
     ::EMERGENCY // System is unusable.
     ::ALERT // Action must be taken immediately.
     ::CRITICAL  // Critical conditions.
     ::ERROR // Runtime errors that do not require immediate action but should typically be logged and monitored.

stdout << log
when LogLevel
     ::WARNING // Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
     ::NOTICE // Normal but significant events.
     ::INFO // Interesting events.
     ::DEBUG // Detailed debug information.
```
